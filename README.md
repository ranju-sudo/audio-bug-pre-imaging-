Audio bug pre imaging 

Overview

Audio Bug Pre-Imaging is a utility designed to capture and diagnose audio-related bugs before they manifest in production environments. It provides a controlled environment for detecting and isolating potential issues with audio systems or components in hardware and software stacks. This tool focuses on identifying anomalies, glitches, or deviations in audio output, helping developers to address issues earlier in the development process.
